I am a conversation that can be completed in a streaming way, i.e., new messages will be appended asynchronously. This is either used for tool calls, where a single user message may trigger multiple assistant messages and tool messages, or for proactive models (e.g., OpenAIRealtimeSession) which may produce new messages at any time. Users can listen to my #streamingStarted and #completed events (besides #newMessagea nd #removedMessage, which are also emitted without streaming).
